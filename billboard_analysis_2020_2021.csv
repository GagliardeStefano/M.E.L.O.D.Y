Sí, no me quiero quedar dormido, no me quiero desmayar
Estuve pensando en nuestro futuro porque nunca veré esos días
No sé por qué esto ha sucedido, pero probablemente me lo merezco
Intenté dar lo mejor de mí, pero sabes que no soy perfecto
He estado orando por el perdón, tú has estado orando por mi salud
Cuando me vaya de esta tierra, esperando que encuentres a alguien más
Porque sí, seguimos siendo jóvenes, hay mucho que no hemos hecho
Casarse, formar una familia, mirar a tu esposo con su hijo
Ojalá pudiera ser yo, pero no saldré de esta cama
Espero ir al cielo así podré verte una vez más

Filmando videos bobos y caminando por del parque
Saltarías en mis brazos al escuchar un ladrido
Nos acurrucaríamos en tus sábanas, me cantarías dormida
Y nos escaparíamos por tu cocina exactamente a las 1:03

Весь мой сквад тут на тусе ходит туда-сюда
Помесь зомби апокалипсиса и Бобби Хинана ""Мозга"" я
Ведь со мной вновь сражается также моя же мания
Shady вернулся, взрывать пора
Говоришь, от меня клонит в сон тебя?
Вот тогда тебе бессоница
У тебя дефицит внимания, успокойся и слушай сейчас меня
Чел, выпей коньяка
Убью из АК с кулака, для меня это не больше, чем игра
Отсякай, видишь меня отступай, тут орёт тревога
Этот бит сумасшедший, смешной (хах), как будто Ray J
Угараю по дороге до банка, брызжа слюной, вам не успокоить
Во мне...

Монстра
Встанешь на пути моём, скормлю тебя монстру
Весь день такой как ты, но ночью превращаюсь в монстра
При свете луны, что сияет так ясно
Я становлюсь злодеем. Это мой блокбастер
Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол
Всё горит, Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол

Я лишь продукт Слика Рика из Оникса, своим треком их ужасну
Разозлю, хоть их сотни всех. Невозможно даже перечесть
И вдобавок ко всему этому я в психушке в руках верчу
Магический шар
В попытках узнать, каково будет завтра:
После рисперидона будет ли шанс?
Мой кулак, будто карандаш, чертит круги на стене
Черти кричат все во мне
Эта песня даст веру тебе
Ты направил свой ствол на парня с базукой в руке
Я из Лох-Несса вылез, прямо из мифов
Как только грохну свой полтиник водки
Лишь откручу крышку, ты увидишь...

Монстра
Встанешь на пути моём, скормлю тебя монстру
Весь день такой как ты, но ночью превращаюсь в монстра
При свете луны, что сияет так ясно
Я становлюсь злодеем. Это мой блокбастер
Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол
Всё горит, Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол

Если тебе так же пох, руки вверх!
Ведь я уже собрался в отдых. Бэд Трип подъехал
Нахожусь на месте, как мой индекс, теперь всё, что ты увидишь
Лишь мой средний палец, подниму выше!
Как у меня могут быть только фаны?
Горю, как у лжеца память
Я не думал вас даже оставить без восхищений текстами
И эти дамы прекрасны, меня заводят опасно
И я их очаровал всех, они теряют сознание
И всё снова крутится, крутится, словно цепь бензопилы
Я машу волшебной палочкой, как битой, исполню мечты
Сука, я сделал эти бабки слишком просто как Кид Инк
Называй меня Дидди
Создаю группы, что мне дают прибыль
Слышь, я в игре, скуп на делёж, что принадлежит мне
Я не дам слова тебе, не притворюсь даже, мэн
Но я сказал суке, что женюсь на ней, если она после будет в земле
Я как Ричард Рамирес ебашу людей
Не стою на месте, как Кристиан Ривера
Все мои тексты вихляют подобно мне
Как при параличе, это страшно, я зову что Гарри Карей
Ведь каждый Том. Дик и Гарри всегда имеют грёбанный словарь при себе
Это смешно и нелепо. Ведь они подобно мне
Трясутся над ним, божатся, клянутся над ним
Пришло время пересечься с глазу на глаз с этой острой проблемой
Пора быстрее, составить некролог о каждом. Теперь и мне похер, поверь
Пора палить, зарядил ствол, полон чернил он
Злая половина меня сместит вновь, и людей привлекают мои тексты всё ещё
Он смотрят на них, как на гангстеров
Будто я буду щас стрелять всех
Каждый трей, как джингл, в магазин вложил их
Теперь пришло время их всех положить!
Наполняю ядом и рядом перебиваю
Другими словами, я из них соки выжимаю
Не хотел убивать всех, но я в приступе ярости
Ты не в силах сбежать теперь, я не чувствую жалости
Они меня ненавидят, и я не знаю усталости, и вот я настигаю их
И перемалываю в ярости
Я чувствую, будто бы стал на голову тронутым, во мне демон
И я знаю, он по крови их голоден
Либо ты убиваешь, либо убит будешь скоро ты, я подорву тебя
И раскидаю в разные стороны
Моя каждая часть сделана из зла и насилия
Если ты меня увидишь, то поверь, ты бессилен
Убегай или молись, но никак не беси меня, или в ту же минуту
Я разорву на куски тебя
Ты не станешь как я даже на пару процентов
Я собираюсь покончить с тобой, ты знаешь об этом
Меня подобные тебе вызывают на бэттл, но я не победим
Вовсе не убиваем и неподелен
Переделываю строки и не знаю предела я
У меня есть много денег, они раскиданы в трейлере
Я не боюсь потянутся за моим...
Чел стой
Смотри что в планах!

Levei ela pro Follies porque a buceta dela tá piscando
Eu corro igual a Nike, nós deixamos tudo fechado

Óculos da Cartier
Eu sou o chefe de terno, mas sem gravata
Eu não posso ficar sóbrio, eu tenho que ficar chapado
Me sirva um pouco de xarope em um Canada Dry
Andando na nave espacial igual Bonnie e Clyde
Não se preocupe, baby, eu levo algumas armas
Shenenehs e Birkins, ela não consegue decidir
A nova Mercedes vai deixar ela surpresa
Não durma senhorita, sua buceta é um prêmio
Pau na bunda dela enquanto eu agarro sua cintura
Maybach grande, esse não é do tamanho normal
Nós realmente voamos, nós gostamos de planar igual um pelicano
Vadia, você não é esperta, eu posso dizer o disfarce
Atualizei o meu pulso, coloquei baguettes naquele Sky
Ela canta, eu posso assinar e mudar toda a vida dela
Eu disse pra ela gargarejar e trabalhar nos seus altos

Tudo é foda, eu adoro quando tá quente
Virei na cidade, eu quebrei o entalhe
Tenho mais alguns milhões, eu me mantenho num nó
Eu criei uma história e consegui demais
Ele tentou me desprezar e acabou na Fox

Levei ela pro Follies porque a buceta dela tá piscando

Grana, dinheiro, cheques, grana
Addy, Birkin, pentes novos em folha
Eu só quero foder a vadia sozinho
Eu acabei de passar ela pro meu parça igual a minha Sprite

Eu coloquei a vadia na frente do Bentley, na frente do motorista (Skrrt)
Ayy, cara, essa erva é sintética, você não pode fumar no Rolls Royce, woah, woah (Yeah, yeah)
Eu ainda tô com o copo duplo, tô bebendo, eu atiro nos seus pneus, huh (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Eu tô no carro sozinho
Tive que chutar uma porta quando eu tinha 5
Guado os prêmios na prateleira
16 rodadas inteiras na arma
Eu tô farto desses jovens manos agindo como se estivessem atirando, eles contando essas mentiras
Agindo como se fossem os que criaram isso e tiram todo o estilo dos meus parceiros
Yeah, óculos da Cartier
Casaco da Cartier, Cartier é o relógio
Amor pela Cartier, gostosa da Cartier
Especificações da Cartier, búfalo na lateral
Diamantes lapidados, eles são da Cartier, yeah
Bolsa da Cartier pra gostosa da Cartier
Sky Wrangler é o carro com 200 no painel
Jeans da Cartier, de jeito nenhum eu posso afundar
De jeito nenhum eu nunca vou sair mal
Eu não posso sair, não vou sair de jeito nenhum
Eu só agarro a bunda dela e exibo
Eu me sento como um campeão e espero uma resistência
Eu apenas preparo um novo Chanel Patek
Eu dirijo com o pulso e não arranco a porta
Transformo o último andar inteiro em um bordel
100 mil em um, o cara trouxe a inundação

I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OGs salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""

I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a GOAT, I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people

2020,76,The Bigger Picture,Lil Baby,"Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd (
Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up
)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)

Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah

It's bigger than black and white

Po czterech rundach, zostawiam siniaki na twoich udach
Jesteś jedyną suką która może sprawić że rzucę się na facetów
I jedyna suką która sprawia że chcę się spuścić kiedy jestem w środku
To twój klimat, odejdź ze mną jesteś najarana
Dziewczyno, wszystkie suki są niczym przy tobie nawet gdy próbują
Ona jest tsunami, nigdy nie poczułem jej suchej
Zamykam oczy kiedy śpię, mam nadzieję że będziesz tam kiedy się obudzę
Szczerze mówiąc, czuję że atmosfera którą mamy jest świetna
I jeśli masz cos na myśli, możesz mi powiedzieć
I jeśli powiedział by mi co jest na mojej, czy pomogłabyś mi?
Zobaczysz większy obraz, to po prostu zajmie trochę czasu
Tylko dlatego że jesteś moja, sprawię, że będziesz wyglądać jak diament
Nie ma żadnych niedoskonałości, dziewczyno, jesteś niezła
Kochanie, jaki jest twój znak?
Mam nadzieje że nie jesteś wolna gdy pracujesz
(Praca, praca, to ja i ty) Ja i ty
Bądź cicho, teraz nie ma niczego czego nie możemy zrobić
Przez storm, kochanie, my możemy przez to przejść
Dlaczego zachowujesz się jak nowa? Wiesz że jesteś moją laską, tak
Wstałem na mojego Birkina, to działa
Powiedziała, że jest dziewicą (to boli)
Jest moim największym fanem, ona zawsze jest przyczajona
I wie że jestem mężczyzną, ja na to zapracuję
Wiem, że mnie nie znosi, jestem luksusowy
Więc przyprowadzę ją, kiedy dostanę Grammy

2020,93,Does To Me,Luke Combs Featuring Eric Church,"I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them

Patlattım Pinot Grigio marka şarabı
Porsche ile yanaşıyorum, yanımda fena bir kaltak
Porshce'u park edip Lambo'ya atlıyorum
İniyorum, Major Payne, kamuflaj giyiniyorum
Sevimli hatunu sevişmeye zorladım, sevgilisini bıraktı
Ateş etmeyi ve seni sevindirmeyi severim, ben Ramboyum
Cuban Chain elmaslarla dolu, boynumu boğuyor adeta
Huzur içinde yat Pop, ölümün yaktırdı bana bir cigara

Bazı yanlışlar yaptım, ama her zaman haklıydım
Nasıl ateş edildiğini bildiğimi söylemiştim ve nasıl kavga edeceğimi de biliyorum
Bir defa söylemişsem yeterli, İkinci kere söylemeyeceğim

You're like a broken home to me

And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams

Like one day you'll come back to me

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

How every day gets worse for me

Ich komme nicht gut mit dem Drama klar
Und nein, ich kann nicht ertragen, dass es falsch ist

Aber sie sehen dich nicht so, wie ich dich sehe, Parlay und Desi

Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex

I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked

I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

But honestly, it ain't nobody's business what's in my cup, what's in your cup, what's in they cup
It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup, the only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done, I probably should pick that cup back up (Haha)

I'm sittin' here lookin' at Keisha, like, ""Do you love me, do you love me not?""
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (Candy), sweet like fruit (Ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she minе (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm), I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (Too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve (See)

One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks

I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the liter
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (Too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (That strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' up my home (In my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you 'lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with her hard to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (That somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)
I gotta stop it, I must stop it

To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand

And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over

This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days, we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark

But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday, we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life

Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow

Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

Adicionei dois zeros no um, eu tô em um modo diferente
Essa é a minha vida, faço o que eu quero, eu tô com putas diferentes
Você sabe qual é a jogada, eu peguei ela e mandei pra casa
Eu fiquei muito rico, nós colocamos e retiramos
Você sabe que o Trappy acabou de sair, eu não tenho que colocá-lo na linha
Somos aqueles que tem os números, que colocaram a cidade no mapa
Estamos no meio do verão, eu coloquei um moletom
Meu tempo de braveza não é nada bom
Eu tento não vestir a mesma coisa duas vezes
Eu saí de um jogo de dados, yeah
Meu irmãozinho não tá vivendo direito
Minha irmã e eles estão bem
Meu primo e eles ainda servindo à vida, yeah
Vi um ladrão roubando a religião
Eu vi um pregador ser pego por trair
Eu vou falir o banco por um do meu povo
Eu disse: ""Eu sou o único"", eles não acreditaram em mim
Eu mostro os fatos pra eles, agora todos precisam de mim
Eu vou ter grana enquanto estiver respirando
Eles tornam isso difícil, essa merda é muito fácil, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Eu vou acabar com um hater em cada chance que tiver
Eu quero o maior relógio que eles têm, não me importo se essa merda vai machucar o meu pulso
Todas essas putas transam com todos nós, eu gostaria de mandar naquela vadia
Elas ficam excitadas quando pegam nas armas, nós temos um armário cheio de peças
Assim que eles dizem que não podemos ir, você sabe que vamos correr em volta daquela porra
Você pode sentir a minha falta com essa merda, você sabe que eu vivo na mistura (Dinheiro, carros e roupas e putas)

Coloquei roupas da Givenchy nos meus filhos
Ela deve pensar que um mais um é três
Eu não posso te apoiar pessoalmente
Ela não tem hipoteca, foi morar com a sobrinha
Esses manos estão mentindo, os carros são alugados
O mais novo tá no comando, eu falo pelas ruas
Eu tava cochilando, eles acordaram uma fera
Aprendi lutando, costumávamos ter água pro jantar, não tínhamos nada pra comer

Os manos são durões na internet, mas realmente estão lá pra chamar a atenção
As vadias ficam conversando como se fossem realmente ricas
Mas realmente ficam implorando pra aparecer nas minhas fotos
Eu vou dar pra ela 40, 50 mil em dinheiro pra abrir um negócio
Eu vou gastar essa merda no dentista
Eu prefiro transar com ela e pagar o aluguel dela por um ano só pra me livrar dos sentimentos dela
Eu tô na Lambo' SUV no meu bairro, ninguém vai me dizer nada
Indo pra Cali, eu pego a minha erva com certeza, ninguém vai me
Mandar nada

O Baby deixou o bairro dele muito bem, yeah, você pode dizer que eles são realmente ricos
Larguei a carga, não tem espaço agora, eu levei ela pro O

Missionary or doggystyle, I'ma top shit
Pussy-ass niggas hatin' on me from the closet, ah
Hoes tryna call me a snake, shit, I guess I can relate
'Cause a bitch spit a whole lotta venom
And since these hoes all rats, when they come around me
All I see is a whole lotta dinner
I walk around the house butt-naked
And I stop at every mirror just to stare at my own posterior
I don't give a fuck who talk behind my back
'Cause the bitch knew better than to let me hear her (Ah)

Ninety-nine percent tint in a blacked-out Wraith
I remember hoes used to clap for me happily
Now I'm bossed up and them same hoes mad at me
Acting like they ridin', whole time tryna pass me
Watchin' me go through it and still tryna drag me
Actin' like you winnin', if you think about it, actually

My chain ain't hittin' if a bitch ain't hurtin'
Look, I ain't even finna argue with a bitch

And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet

Don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song

Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo
